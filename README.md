# System-monitoring-tool
- Detects and tracks network-connected devices (like routers, switches, firewalls, servers), measuring uptime, latency, bandwidth use and error rates. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}   - Visualizes the network’s topology and traffic flows so administrators can see how data moves and where bottlenecks or faults might be occurring. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- Continuously collects telemetry from hardware and software layers and generates alerts when abnormal behavior or threshold breaches occur—so problems are caught early, not just after failure. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- Enables proactive maintenance, performance optimization, and capacity planning, rather than simply reacting when things go wrong. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  

In short: this tool brings **visibility** into a network by making hidden issues obvious, helping teams maintain reliability, optimize performance, and reduce downtime.
